# Observables.js
Observables.js is "kinda" an implementation of the observable pattern in JS.

## How do I use it?
Look through the [tests](test/) for a good idea. 
I'll put together a decent readme here soon, as well as some examples.

## What's left to do?
I need to have a look at compatability. For now, this is just being published for internal consumption.  
I'll come back to it.
